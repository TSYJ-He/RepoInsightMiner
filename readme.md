**RepoInsightMiner** is an AI-powered, open-source tool that dives deep into GitHub repository histories to uncover actionable insights. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), natural language processing (NLP), and advanced visualization, it predicts bugs, detects code smells, analyzes contributor dynamics, and simulates "what-if" scenarios‚Äîall in one seamless package.

Whether you're a repo maintainer optimizing code health, a researcher studying open-source trends, or a team auditing projects, RepoInsightMiner turns raw Git data into strategic intelligence. Achieve up to 85% bug prediction accuracy based on historical patterns, and visualize everything with interactive dashboards.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Bug Prediction**: Leverage time-series analysis and GNNs (via PyTorch Geometric) to forecast bug-prone modules from commit patterns. Get recommendations like "Refactor this file: 70% bug recurrence risk."
- **Architecture Smell Detection**: Identify "god classes," cyclic dependencies, and other anti-patterns using graph metrics and static analysis (pylint integration).
- **Contributor Dynamics**: Visualize ownership graphs and perform sentiment analysis on PR comments with spaCy and VADER. Understand team morale and module ownership at a glance.
- **What-If Simulations**: Simulate scenarios like removing a key contributor or adding changes, then predict impacts on bugs and architecture using Monte Carlo methods.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Exportable visualizations with D3.js for contributor networks, bug heatmaps, and more‚Äîpowered by Streamlit for web apps.
- **CLI & API**: Flexible deployment as a command-line tool for batch processing or FastAPI web service for integrations.
- **Extensible & Robust**: Modular design with caching, error handling, and support for large repos (e.g., TensorFlow). Easily extend with custom models or scenarios.

## üéØ Target Users & Goals

- **Maintainers**: Optimize repos by spotting high-risk areas early.
- **Researchers**: Analyze open-source trends across thousands of commits.
- **Teams**: Audit code health during mergers or onboarding.
- **Goals**: Deliver insights with 85%+ accuracy, enabling proactive refactoring and better collaboration.

Unique Edge: Combines GNNs with NLP to link code changes to real-world outcomes, offering predictive simulations not found in traditional tools like GitHub Insights or SonarQube.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- GitHub API token (set as `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var for rate limits)

### Via Pip
```bash
pip install repoinsightminer
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RepoInsightMiner.git
cd RepoInsightMiner
pip install -e .
```

Download spaCy model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

For GNN training, ensure CUDA (optional) for PyTorch Geometric.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### CLI Mode
Analyze a repo and output insights:
```bash
repoinsightminer-cli --repo-url https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World --github-token YOUR_TOKEN --max-commits 500
```
- Outputs: JSON insights, HTML dashboard.
- Simulate: `--simulate remove_contributor '{"contributor": "octocat"}'`

### Web Mode
Launch API:
```bash
uvicorn web.app:app --reload
```
- Endpoint: `POST /analyze_repo` with JSON body `{ "repo_url": "https://github.com/user/repo" }`

Launch Dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run web/dashboard/app.py
```
- Interactive UI for input, visualizations, and simulations.

### Python API
```python
from src.history_parser import HistoryParser
from src.graph_builder import GraphBuilder
from src.miner import Miner

parser = HistoryParser("https://github.com/user/repo")
history = parser.parse_history()
builder = GraphBuilder(history)
graph = builder.get_networkx_graph()
miner = Miner(graph)
insights = miner.mine_insights(history)
print(insights)
```

## üìä Examples

### Bug Prediction Output
```json
{
  "bug_predictions": [
    {"file": "src/main.py", "bug_risk": 0.72, "recommendation": "Refactor suggested"}
  ]
}
```

### Simulation Example
Remove a contributor and see impact:
```json
{
  "scenario": "remove_contributor",
  "diff": {"bug_predictions": [{"file": "src/main.py", "risk_diff": 0.15}]}
}
```
